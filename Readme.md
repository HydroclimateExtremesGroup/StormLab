## Introduction
This repository contains code to implement StormLab, 
a stochastic rainfall generator that simulate 6-hour, 
0.03Â° resolution rainfall fields over large-area river basins 
conditioned on global climate model data.

## Installation
`pip install stormlab-1.0-py3-none-any.whl`

## Dependencies
Required packages are listed in requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Download the example data and unzip at the code folder "/StormLab."
	- Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MJzO8bhKJxZ5sc7OuIQQQPw3AmQLKSME/view?usp=sharing
	- The folder should look like: "/StormLab/data"
